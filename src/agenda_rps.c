/*****************************************************************
 *            ABOUT PTHREADS IN RefPerSys
 *
 * We have a fixed amount of pthreads in RefPerSys, and their number
 * is called the number of jobs NJ, and should be settable by some
 * program option, e.g. --jobs=4; that number of jobs should be more
 * than two and less than twenty and less than one more than the
 * number of cores in the CPU.
 *
 * + The main thread, which is loading the heap, and later running the
 * GTK event loop. That main thread can use RPS_ALLOC_ZONE. The GTK
 * event loop accept some GTK updating requests on some pipe from
 * agenda threads.  So we should use one pipe(7) to accept "requests"
 * from agenda threads which wants to display or draw some GTK widget.
 *
 * + Perhaps extra hidden GTK related threads.  These cannot use
 * RPS_ALLOC_ZONE at all.  These threads are not known to RefPerSys,
 * and are supposed to be idle most of the time; they are started and
 * stopped by some internal GTK code.  It might be possible that some
 * versions of GTK are using hidden threads for the clipboard or for
 * large copy/paste into GtkTextView etc...  The reader is requested to
 * dive into the source code of GTK.
 *
 * + The NJ agenda threads.  These threads can use RPS_ALLOC_ZONE but
 * cannot use any GTK routines directly. For any GTK updating
 * requests, an agenda thread should write on the pipe(7) used by the
 * main thread and known by GTK.
